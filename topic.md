# Welcome to My Favorite Places That I've Visted Page!
As I said before, I love to travel; and this page is basically a traveling page explaining some of my favorite places that I have visited in the past couple of years. My wife was the first to fall in love with traveling, and she introduced me to it as soon as our relationship began. Something about being in new places and seeing landmarks that I have only seen on TV is really thrilling to me. We love to travel together and we many pictures to prove it. Our pictures are very important to us because we can look back on them in the future to see all the good times we shared. If you haven't been to any of the places that I will be listing, I HIGHLY reccommend you do visit them if you get the chance. Enjoy!

### 1. Santorini, Greece

This is a volcanic island in the Cyclades group of the Greek islands. It is famous for dramatic views, stunning sunsets from Oia town, the strange white aubergine (eggplant), the town of Thira and naturally its very own active volcano. There so much to do here from all-inclusive yacht tours to trying some of the great Greek cuisine at the restaurants and shopping at all the stores. This is for sure my favorite place to visit and I hope I get a change to go back.

 

### 2. Venice, Italy

Venice was built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has no roads, just canals and itâ€™s known for its bridges. Venice is a beautiful city full of shopping and fresh seafood to go along with the Italian cuisine. Here, you can go on the famous and romantic gondola rides around the city while being serenaded by your gondolier. Definitely a place to visit. 

### 3. Nice, France
