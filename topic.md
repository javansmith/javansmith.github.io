# Welcome to My Favorite Places That I've Visted Page!
As I said before, I love to travel; and this page is basically a traveling page explaining some of my favorite places that I have visited in the past couple of years. My wife was the first to fall in love with traveling, and she introduced me to it as soon as our relationship began. Something about being in new places and seeing landmarks that I have only seen on TV is really thrilling to me. We love to travel together and we many pictures to prove it. Our pictures are very important to us because we can look back on them in the future to see all the good times we shared. If you haven't been to any of the places that I will be listing, I HIGHLY reccommend you do visit them if you get the chance. For each country, there will be a picture of a nice view of the location next to another picture of my own experience. Enjoy!

### 1. Santorini, Greece

This is a volcanic island in the Cyclades group of the Greek islands. It is famous for dramatic views, stunning sunsets from Oia town, the strange white aubergine (eggplant), the town of Thira and naturally its very own active volcano. There so much to do here from all-inclusive yacht tours to trying some of the great Greek cuisine at the restaurants and shopping at all the stores. This is for sure my favorite place to visit and I hope I get a change to go back.

 

### 2. Venice, Italy

Venice was built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has no roads, just canals and it’s known for its bridges. Venice is a beautiful city full of shopping and fresh seafood to go along with the Italian cuisine. Here, you can go on the famous and romantic gondola rides around the city while being serenaded by your gondolier. Definitely a place to visit. 

### 3. Nice, France

Nice is known for its fantastic climate, fabulous beaches and beautiful coastline with mesmerizing views. Also, for its fantastic architecture with Belle Epoque and Baroque influenced buildings. Nice is located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps. You can take a short train ride to Monaco to visit Monte Carlo as well, to kill two birds with one stone. Another MUST visit place. 

### 4. Iceland

Iceland has everything from volcanoes to geysers. I believe it’s best to stay for about a week to experience the whole country from the capital Reykjavík, one of the cleanest, greenest, and safest cities in the world to the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon (and the Diamond Beach), where you’ll find the deepest lagoon with multicolored icebergs that float down to the black beach (Diamond Beach) where the icebergs sit. And of course, my favorite place in Iceland; the famous Blue Lagoon, a world-class spa with a built-in bar, even out lava flooring, a steam cave, a sauna, massage area in the water and more. There also many waterfalls to see throughout the country, and if you go at the right time, you will see the Norther Lights. Iceland is another place you MUST visit.
