# A Little About Me
### Who Am I?
My name is Javan Smith and I am from Inglewood, California. I have been happily married for almost 2 years to my beautiful wife "Amanda", who is in the Navy and we are raising our French Bulldog puppy "Nikko". I am a Navy veteran who I currently works at Iron Works gym (main side), and I'm taking a couple of classes to achieve my Associates Degree at the moment. I have a twin sister who looks absolutely nothing like me, who I am older than by 6 whole minutes. I stay with a positive attitude, and I like to be around other people with postive attitudes.   
#### What I Like To Do
I love to play sports (mainly basketball); as far as watching sports, I like to watch basketball, football, and maybe a little bit of baseball. I love to travel, whether it's local, domestic, or international. I love to go out and explore to see and experience new things; but at the same time, I like to stay in and chill with my wife, family, or friends. I aslo love to meet new people to share experiences with to make new memories.
